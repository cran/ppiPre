Description: Computing similarities between proteins based on their GO annotation, KEGG annotation and PPI network topology. It integrates seven features (TCSS, IntelliGO, Wang, KEGG, Jaccard, RA and AA) to predict PPIs using an SVM classifier. Some internal functions are derived from R package GOSemSim authored by Guangchuang Yu.
